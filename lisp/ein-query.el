(defcustom ein:query-timeout
  (if (eq request-backend 'url-retrieve) 1000 nil)
  "Default query timeout for HTTP access in millisecond.

Setting this to `nil' means no timeout.
If you have ``curl`` command line program, it is automatically set to
`nil' as ``curl`` is reliable than `url-retrieve' therefore no need for
a workaround (see below).

If you do the same operation before the timeout, old operation
will be canceled \(see also `ein:query-singleton-ajax').

.. note:: This value exists because it looks like `url-retrieve'
   occasionally fails to finish \(start?) querying.  Timeout is
   used to let user notice that their operation is not finished.
   It also prevent opening a lot of useless process buffers.
   You will see them when closing Emacs if there is no timeout.

   If you know how to fix the problem with `url-retrieve', please
   let me know or send pull request at github!
